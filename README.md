# Linear-Regression-Project
This Project is based on model data for an Ecommerce company that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. We want to help them figure this out. We have taken below steps in analysing this sample data Please note the data is fake and not associated with any real world company

The Project has 6 main sections:

1-	Getting the Data

2-  Exploratory Data Analysis

3-  Spliting the Data to Test and Train

4-  Training a Linear Regression Model

5-  Prediction using test Data

6-  Evaluating the model

The Jupyter notebook with the code for each section is attached to this repository
